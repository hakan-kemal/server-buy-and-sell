# server-buy-and-sell

Server side of a FullStack Buy-and-Sell application

Products Marketplace clone

Building a simple buy-and-sell app that utilizes a REST API in the back end and React+Redux in the front end.

Learning Goal of this application:

    - Getting familiar and practicing with setting up a REST API back end and React+Redux front end project from scratch.
    - Solidify and correctly implement the theory I've learned in the last weeks, by simulating a possible real-world project.
